# 🌟 Linked Lists: Introduction and Basics 🌟

This directory introduces **Linked Lists**, a foundational data structure in computer science.
Linked Lists consist of nodes connected by pointers, enabling dynamic memory allocation and 
efficient insertion/deletion operations.

---

## 🔍 **What You’ll Learn**

1. **Define Nodes:** Understand the basic building block of a linked list—a node.
2. **Create a Linked List:** Step-by-step guide to create and link nodes in Python.
3. **Traverse a Linked List:** Learn to navigate and print a linked list.
4. **Insert and Delete Nodes:** Master inserting and deleting elements dynamically.
5. **Reverse a Linked List:** Understand how to efficiently reverse a linked list.
6. **Append Nodes:** Learn how to add nodes at the end of the list.

## 🔧 **Code Examples**

- **`linked_lists_intro.py`**: This file demonstrates the basics of creating and traversing a linked list in Python.
- **`linked_list_functions.py`**: Covers essential linked list operations like traversal, insertion, deletion, reversal, and appending.

## 🚀 **How to Run the Code**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChicanaCodes/data-structures-algorithms.git
   cd linkedLists
   ```

2. Run the Python file:
   ```bash
   python linked_lists_intro.py
   python linked_list_functions.py  # Advanced linked list functions
   ```

---

## 🔎 **Example Output**

When you run `linked_lists_intro.py`, you will see:

```
Linked List:
1 🤯 2 🤯 3 🤯 null
```

This indicates the nodes in the linked list (1, 2, and 3) connected sequentially, with `null` marking the end of the list.


When you run `linked_list_functions.py`, you will see additional operations, such as:

```
🔄 Initial Linked List:
1 ➡️ 2 ➡️ 3 ➡️ None
🆕 After Inserting 4 after 2:
1 ➡️ 2 ➡️ 4 ➡️ 3 ➡️ None
🗑️ After Deleting node with value 2:
1 ➡️ 4 ➡️ 3 ➡️ None
🔄 After Reversing the Linked List:
3 ➡️ 4 ➡️ 1 ➡️ None
🎯 After Appending 5 at the End:
3 ➡️ 4 ➡️ 1 ➡️ 5 ➡️ None
```

## 📚 **Key Terms**
| **Term**                 | **Definition**                                                                               |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Node**                 | A single element of a linked list containing data and a pointer.                             |
| **Head**                 | The first node in the linked list, used as the starting point.                               |
| **Tail**                 | The last node in the linked list, its `next` pointer is `None`.                              |
| **Pointer**              | A reference to the next node in the list (or `None` if at the end).                          |
| **Traversal**            | The process of moving through each node in the linked list one by one.                       |
| **Insertion**            | Adding a new node to the linked list, either at the beginning, end, or middle.               |
| **Deletion**             | Removing a node from the linked list and updating pointers accordingly.                      |
| **Reversal**             | Changing the direction of a linked list by reversing the links.                              |
| **Appending**            | Adding a new node at the end of the linked list.                                             |
| **Singly Linked List**   | A type of linked list where each node points only to the next node.                          |
| **Doubly Linked List**   | A linked list where each node has a pointer to both the next and previous nodes.             |
| **Circular Linked List** | A linked list where the last node’s `next` pointer points back to the head, forming a cycle. |
